# ✅ Leap Year Calculator — Python

This project is a small Python program that determines whether a given year is a **leap year** or not.  
The output is displayed using a slow typing animation (`slow_print`), making the program fun and interactive.

## 🧠 How Leap Years Work

A year is a leap year if:

1. It is divisible by **400** → ✅ leap year  
2. Otherwise, if it is divisible by **4** **and NOT** divisible by **100** → ✅ leap year  
3. Otherwise → ❌ not a leap year

This program applies these exact rules.
